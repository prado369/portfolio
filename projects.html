                <p class="p">In this exercise, we'll be creating PacMen with the click of a button.
                        Each click will create a new PacMan that begins moving across the screen.
                        These PacMen ultimately collide with the edges and bounce towards a different direction.
                        We'll create an empty array into which we'll push and store each new PacMan.
                        We'll have to mirror our code in the DOM and position our images there.</p>

                <p class="p">In this exercise, we're given a web page with a single eye in which the eyeball follows the mouse movement.
                        We've added a second eye so that it looks like a person's eyes following that mouse.
                        Both eyes must be synchronized while matching the mouse movement.</p>
